Inclusive design has become a strategic priority in modern retail, shaping how customers experience physical spaces. 
In this case, Starbucks partnered with McKinsey & Company to rethink store design through the lens of inclusion, accessibility, and belonging, ensuring that stores serve customers, partners, and communities of all abilities and backgrounds.

Starbucks operates thousands of stores globally, serving diverse customer needs. However, traditional store layouts and design standards were not always optimized for people with disabilities, neurodiverse customers, caregivers, or aging populations. 
The challenge was to create inclusive environments without compromising operational efficiency or brand consistency.

McKinsey supported Starbucks in developing a structured inclusive-design framework. This involved deep research, empathy-based design workshops, and collaboration with accessibility experts, employees, and customers. 
The team identified barriers related to mobility, sensory overload, navigation, seating, and service flow.

Using these insights, Starbucks redesigned store elements such as entrance accessibility, seating configurations, counter heights, lighting, acoustics, signage, and queue layouts. 
The goal was to reduce friction, improve comfort, and enable customers to engage with stores independently and confidently.

Pilot implementations showed measurable improvements. Inclusive store designs led to higher customer satisfaction scores, increased dwell time, and improved employee confidence when serving diverse needs. 
Importantly, the designs proved scalable, allowing Starbucks to embed inclusion into standard store formats across regions.

This case demonstrates how inclusive design is not just a social initiative but a business enabler, strengthening customer loyalty, brand trust, and long-term growth.
